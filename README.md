In case of any disaster, the first step is to formulate a critical response team to help those in distress. Before the team goes into action, it is important to analyze and assess the extent of damage and to ensure that the right aid goes first to those who need it the most. 
So I will be using image recognition and classification to analyze and observe images from satellites and google maps.They can immediately and efficiently filter these images, which would have required months to be sorted manually.It will identify objects and features such as damaged buildings, flooding, blocked roads from these images
also it will identify temporary settlements which may indicate that people are homeless, and so the first care could be directed towards them. 
Using Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools I will also aggregate and crunch data from multiple resources such as crowd-sourced mapping materials or Google maps. Machine learning approaches then combine all this data together, remove unreliable data, and identify informative sources to generate heat maps. These heat maps can identify areas in need of urgent assistance and direct relief efforts to those areas. 
Heat maps are also helpful for government and other humanitarian agencies in deciding where to conduct aerial assessments.
